      "Where do you see the business going? What's the future of the business here? I think I better. I don't think it will go down. It's been stable. The pastures was last year was bad, very bad. But when I went away, I mean this year. This winter was terrible and I had to keep the business closed because of snow and in the winter is very bad, because this stuff is very cool. Harley people come especially January is a badman after the holidays. People you know, they're broke and they're sort of January's a very bad man, but I haven't seen. Last year was the year that I saw that I went the last couple of years. It's not like it used to be, but I always figure out something that I make to pay my bills and keep up with the business trying to survive. E. Just don't say I'm going to stop, but what I have right now my goal for my future because with my husband and I were talking about, I would be glad to sell the business and going to teaching here addressing That's what I would like to do as I get older. Since I have the experience of years, I would like to go get my finished. I have to get, uh, 400. I was more in the academy, then have to go for a course in college for teaching. It's a total of 800 hours. And they took us already found. You know, I went to find out how what I have to do. And I would like to work like communication school, you know, like, because in vocational school, they they teach hairdressing, which I work. I I wanna be working from me to 3. 30 and then I have my summers off. I would like to do that in the future. That what I learned through the years so I could show others. I would like to go into that instead of keeping with the business until I be retired. I don't wanna go through that. I'd rather go into teaching because things profession gets a lot out of you. It really does, especially your nerve. Because you have to be working. Uh, listen to people then put up with people. Sometimes you get nice people. Sometimes you don't. Then the stress from the work and it's not that easy. It takes a lot from you a lot. It's like me. I'm 20 years and I don't really feel tired. I wanna go into something that I'd be doing less the same thing about less mhm.\n"
